# Trampole file encoder
## Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
## Description:


#### What is the use of this program?
Did you ever felt the need to protect your data from others?, if you are working with sensitive data and you like to somehow make your file unusable to other people you can encode your data using this program, it uses encoding techniques that make your data unreadable if you don't have the key to decode it.
So you encode your file with a password key. you remember the key and that's it, only you can access that data.


#### Encoding data:
When you run the project there are 4 options to choose,
    1: Encode a file
    2: List of encoded files in a directory
    3: Decode a file
    0: Exit
For encoding a file you must enter 1
after doing that you should provide a valid full path to your file in your computer and a key of your choice, then if the path is valid you will get a prompt with a new path to your new file which is encoded form of your original file.


#### Decoding data:
Assuming you have a encoded file which is the ouput of this program, you can now decode it if you have the key,
if you don't have they key, you can't do anything.
After running the program you should enter 3 to decode your file, then the program will ask you a path and a key, if you enter both correctly you will get a new promp which shows you the new path to your decoded file.

#### Listing encoded files:
If you don't remember which files have been encoded, no problem, you can use the program itself to show you list of encoded files.
After running the program you should enter 2, then you should provide a valid path to a directory then wait a second for it to search in the directory for the encoded files. it doesn't matter if you chaned the encoded file's name or not, it will show you the list of file unless you didn't provided a valid path.

#### Exiting:
Are you done with the program?
You should just enter 0 then the program will terminate itself.


If you saw anything wrong with the program let me know in the issue section.
